# Space-Invaders-Student-Clone
I am studying how to do games with Godot engine, and in my classes my teacher is teaching how to make a game making a Space Invaders game with Godot engine and using GD script. I am sharing this and maybe someone could be interested in it to learn or make some changes. Welcome everyone!
I think it is necessary (or better) to have Godot engine to work on this project. 
I am using the version 2.1.5 of Godot engine on Linux Ubuntu 18.04. The version 3 I am not sure if it will work th same way, maybe it is better using the same version.
